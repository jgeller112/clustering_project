Data
----

Eighty-four participants (one participant was not used due to some weird
coding issue) took part in a free speech classification task. The speech
samples were selected from The Speech Accent Archive. The talkers
included three American English regional dialects, three international
English dialects, and nine nonnative accents. The nonnative accents were
split into three accents from East Asia, three accents from South Asia,
and three accents from Southeast Asia. The American English dialects
included the New England dialect, the Southern dialect, and the Midland
dialect. The international English dialects included British English,
Australian English, and Africaans. The native languages of the
nonnative-accented talkers were Mandarin, Korean, and Japanese from East
Asia, Bengali, Gujarati, and Urdu from South Asia, and Indonesian,
Tagalog, and Thai from Southeast Asia. We have data in wide format. Each
row is a talker type and each col is a participant.
